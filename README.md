# PeopleHub

## About

PeopleHub is an Android application that allows users to store their contacts in a more detailed and organized manner. Thanks to its features of saving detailed personal information such as name, surname, email, age, and grouping these contacts, users can manage their address book more effectively.

## Features

- Detailed storage of personal information
- Grouping of contacts
- Editing and deleting personal information
- Loading icons for each group using Glide Library

## Technologies and Tools Used

This application was developed using significant libraries and tools in the process of Android application development:

- **Android Room Database**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library built on SQLite, Room facilitates database operations.
- **Fragments**: Fragments were used to manage UI parts and to reuse them within an interface.
- **Navigation Drawer**: A navigation component that helps users navigate within the application.
- **Fragment Lifecycle**: Understanding and effectively managing the lifecycle of fragments.
- **Glide Library**: We used the Glide library to load icons for each group in the application. Glide is a powerful and efficient image loading library for Android.
